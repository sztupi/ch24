Hey What you talking about.. We Three Were always together!! :-PP

have submitted it 7 times now problem-2 still gettin compiler error..i am using dev-c++

Yes,I agree with TeamRed... I'm using Dev-Cpp... And I have submitted my code with both compilers... 'n still Compile Error....

i m using gcc 3.2.2. and solution to 2nd problem is correct on my system. but you have shown it wrong. how come?

i m using dev c++ and output is coming for certain test cases still i m getting wrong answer 
any suggestions????

I am hetting segmentation fault error although it works fine in Dev c++ and also in linux gcc . What's the problem ?

please tell us why can't use gets()

sir,how long it will continue to show checking?????

sir, the program for problem2 works fine in local system using g++, but it is showing segmentation fault!!

I am getting a message saying compiler error
what does it mean??? i saved my program in .c file. and sent the notepad form of it. I wrote the .c type program in a .cpp compiler. please help us.
The solution for problem2 returns answer in my machine,but it says 'malicious code' 
What seems to be the problem ? Shouldn't I use clrscr() and getch() function in my code.

anyway guys i understand ur bums turned red gazing d monitor but somthng to cheer bout.....2mrw is V-day!so gear up to line maro some babes!
