Inigo Montoya: Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father: prepare to die. Now, offer me money. 
[slices Count Rugen's cheek] 
Count Rugen: Yes. 
Inigo Montoya: Power too. Promise me that. 
[slices Count Rugen's other cheek] 
Count Rugen: All that I have and more. Please... 
Inigo Montoya: Offer me everything I ask for. 
Count Rugen: Any thing you want. 
Inigo Montoya: I want my father back, you son of bitch. 
[stabs and kills Count Rugan]

Inigo Montoya: You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you. 
Westley: You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.

[Fencing] 
Inigo Montoya: You are wonderful. 
Man in Black: Thank you; I've worked hard to become so. 
Inigo Montoya: I admit it, you are better than I am. 
Man in Black: Then why are you smiling? 
Inigo Montoya: Because I know something you don't know. 
Man in Black: And what is that? 
Inigo Montoya: I... am not left-handed. 
[Moves his sword to his right hand and gains an advantage] 
Man in Black: You are amazing. 
Inigo Montoya: I ought to be, after 20 years. 
Man in Black: Oh, there's something I ought to tell you. 
Inigo Montoya: Tell me. 
Man in Black: I'm not left-handed either. 
[Moves his sword to his right hand and regains his advantage]

Col. Jessep: You want answers? 
Kaffee: I think I'm entitled. 
Col. Jessep: You want answers? 
Kaffee: I want the truth. 
Col. Jessep: You can't handle the truth.

Kaffee: Did you order the Code Red? 
Col. Jessep: I did the job I... 
Kaffee: [shouting] Did you order the Code Red? 
Col. Jessep: [shouts] You're goddamn right I did!

Col. Jessep: What do you wanna discuss now? My favorite color? 
Kaffee: Colonel, a moment ago you said that you ordered Lieutenant Kendrick to tell his men that Santiago wasn't to be touched. 
Col. Jessep: That's right. 
Kaffee: And Lieutenant Kendrick was clear on what you wanted? 
Col. Jessep: Crystal. 
Kaffee: Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick ignored the order? 
Col. Jessep: Ignored the order? 
Kaffee: Any chance he forgot about it? 
Col. Jessep: No. 
Kaffee: Any chance Lieutenant left your office and said, 'The old man is wrong'? 
Col. Jessep: No. 
Kaffee: When Lieutenant Kendrick spoke to the Platoon, and ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him? 
Col. Jessep: You ever served in an infantry unit, son? 
Kaffee: No, sir. 
Col. Jessep: Ever served in a forward area? 
Kaffee: No, sir. 
Col. Jessep: Ever put your life in another man's hands: asked him to put his life in yours? 
Kaffee: No, sir. 
Col. Jessep: We follow orders, son. We follow orders, or people die; it's that simple. Are we clear? 
Kaffee: Yes, sir. 
Col. Jessep: [nearly shouting] Are we clear? 
Kaffee: Crystal. Colonel, I've just one more question before I call Airman O'Malley and Airman Rodriguez; if you gave an order that Santiago wasn't to be touched, and your orders ar always followed, then why would Santiago be in danger? Why would it be necessary to transfer him off the base?

Col. Jessep: So how is your dad, Danny? 
Kaffee: He passed away seven years ago, sir. 
Col. Jessep: Don't I feel like the fucking asshole? 
Kaffee: Not at all sir.

Kaffee: Oh, spare me the psychobabble father bullshit.

William Somerset: [to Tracy] Anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable. Just ask your husband. 
David Mills: Very true. Very, very true.

David Mills: Yeah, a landlord's dream: a paralyzed tenant with no tongue. 
William Somerset: Who pays the rent on time.

David Mills: Fuckin' Dante... poetry-writing faggot! Piece of shit, motherfucker!

William Somerset: People don't want a hero, they want to eat cheeseburgers, play the lotto and watch television.

"Dave, my mind is going! I can feel it! I can feel it!"

Iceman: You two really are cowboys. 
Maverick: What's your problem, Kazanski? 
Iceman: You're everyone's problem. That's because everytime you go up in the air, you're unsafe. I don't like you because you're dangerous. 
Maverick: That's right! Ice... man. I am dangerous.

Viper: In case some of you are wondering who the best is they are up here on this plaque. 
[turns to Maverick] 
Viper: Do you think your name will be on that plaque? 
Maverick: Yes sir. 
Viper: That's pretty arrogant considering the company here, don't you think? 
Maverick: Yes sir. 
Viper: I like that in a pilot.

Hotel guest: "Must be some cockroach."

Ray: "I think we better split up." 
Egon: "Good idea." 
Venkman: "Yeah... we can do more damage that way."

Sean Connery (Ramirez): With heart, faith and steel. In the end there can be only one.

Robin Williams (John Keating): O Captain, my Captain. Who knows where that comes from? Anybody? Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in this class you can either call me Mr. Keating, or if you're slightly more daring, O Captain my Captain.

Robin Williams (John Keating): Carpe diem!

Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter): Hello, Clarice.

Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling): If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir? 
Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal): Who can say. Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.

Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal): Why do you think he removes their skins, Agent Starling? 
[sarcastically] 
Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal): Thrill me with your acumen. 
Jodie Foster (Clarice): It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies from their victims. 
Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal): I didn't. 
Jodie Foster (Clarice): No. No, you ate yours.

Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal): I do wish we could chat longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner. Bye.
