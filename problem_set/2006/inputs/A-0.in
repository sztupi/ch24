"This is Ambassador Delenn of the Minbari. Babylon 5 is under our protection. Withdraw, .. or be destroyed." [in the White Star!]
"Negative. We have authority here. Do not force us to engage your ship."
"Why not? Only one human captain has ever survived battle with a Minbari fleet. He is behind me. You are in front of me. If you value your lives, be somewhere else."

"The One is hurt. Must find. Zathras must find help."
"What are you doing here?"
"Need this place. Need this. Used to fight. They told Zathras, biggest of all Babylon stations we need. Needing we take. There is no more to telling."

"Zathras tells, maybe we don't break Zathras' scrawny little neck."

"Much apologizing. Mathematics not Zathras' skill."

"There you are. Being very honored to meet you. I'm being called.."
"Zathras. We've met before on Babylon 4."
"No. .. Zathras does not.."
"It was my past, your future. Zathras, this is very important. When you meet me again, it will be me, but it won't be me now. So, you are not say anything that may change the past. Do you understand?"
"Zathras understand. .. No. Zathras not understand, but Zathras do. Zathras good at doings, not understandings. Zathras honored to meet you for many reasons."

"Zathras also honored to meet you .. for other reasons."
"Oh, such as?"
"Oh, no, Draal give Zathras list of things not to say. This was one. No, not good. Not supposed to mention one, or the One or .. You never heard that."
"What else is on this list of things you are not supposed to mention?"
"Zathras does not remember. But if Zathras remember later, Zathras tells you."

"Yes, yes, Zathras is used to being beast of burden to other people's needs. Very sad life. Probably have very sad death, but at least there is symmetry. Go, go, Zathras take care."

"Carry this, Zathras. Fix this, Zathras. Poor Zathras, no one listen .. to Zathras, but no one.."

"No one ever listens to Zathras. Quite mad, they say. It is good that Zathras does not mind. He's even grown to like it. Oh yes."

"Excuse me, I need to see Draal."
"Oh, Draal is very busy! Have had four ground quakes on other side of planet. Damage to weather control system, to great machine."
"Zathras!"
"Yes?"
"What the hell are you doing here?"
"Zathras work here. Zathras were born here. You work up there, Zathras work down here. You dress like that, Zathras dress like this."
"That's not--"
"Just covering all possibilities. Zathras does not want you being confoosed. Bye."
"Hey! Wait a minute! You are not supposed to be here. We left you a thousand years in the past."
"No! We have never met before. But Zathras very pleased to be meeting you."
"No, we have met."
"No. Oh. No, noo. No no. You did not meet Zathras. You met Zathras."

"Let's try this again."
"As you wish."
"Zathras came with us to Babylon 4."
"Yes."
"Zathras stayed in the past with Valen."
"Yes."
"You are Zathras."
"Yes."
"Therefore, you went into the past."
"No, that was not Zathras, that was Zathras. There are 10 of us, all of family Zathras, each one named Zathras. Slight differences in how you pronounce. Zathraas, Zathras, Zathras.. You are seeing now?"
"There are ten of you?"
"Yes! Well, nine now."
"And Zathras?"
"Zathras gone! Zathras warned Zathras, but Zathras never listened to Zathras. Zathras was quiet one in family. SO! What can Zathras be doing for you?"

"Everyone always coming to Zathras with problems. Great responsibilities. But Zathras does not mind. Zathras trained in crisis management."
"That's great, lets--"
"But only Zathras have no one to talk to. No one manages poor Zathras, you see. So Zathras talks to dirt. Sometimes talks to walls, or talks to ceilings. But dirt is closer. Dirt is used, through everyone walking on it. Just like Zathras, but we've come to like it. It is our role. It is our destiny in the universe. So, you see, sometimes dirt has insects in it. And Zathras likes insects. Not so good for conversation, but much proteine for diet. Ha! Zathras fix now, this way."

"No. No. No. No-no. Not good. No, no."
"Come on, find what you need and lets get away from here. We are running out of time."
"Can not run out of time, there is infinite time. You are finite, Zathras is finite. This is wrong tool. No. No. Not good. No. No. Never use this."

Captain Elizabeth Lochley: What the hell is your problem? 
Michael Garibaldi: For starters, I don't know you, therefore I don't trust you. 
Captain Elizabeth Lochley: The world is full of people you don't know. 
Michael Garibaldi: I worry about that all the time.

Mr. Morden: What do YOU want? 
Ambassador Vir Cotto: I'd like to live just long enough to be there when they cut off your head and stick it on a pike as a warning to the next ten generations that some favors come with too high a price. I want to look up into your lifeless eyes and wave like this. 
[waves] 
Ambassador Vir Cotto: Can you and your associates arrange that for me, Mr. Morden?

Ambassador Londo Mollari: Everyone around me dies, Mr. Morden, except those who most deserve it.

Kosh Naranek: Understanding is a three-edged sword.

Kosh Naranek: The avalanche has already started; it is too late for the pebbles to vote.

PsiCop Alfred Bester: Well, there is just no delicate way to say this. 
[pause] 
PsiCop Alfred Bester: I want your body. 
Lyta Alexander: [shouts] What? Are you out of your mind?

Susan Ivanova: I am Susan Ivanova, Commander. Daughter of Andre and Sophie Ivanov. I am the right hand of vengeance and the boot that is going to kick your sorry ass all the way back to Earth, goddammit! I am death incarnate, and the last living thing that you are ever going to see. God sent me.
